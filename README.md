# Gasifier production

This website contains videos that show you how to make your own gasifier, e.g. to cook your meals. Please [contribute to our videos[here](https://github.com/zorbathegreek/gasifier-production/blob/master/how-to-contribute.md) if you can. We trained groups of women, and would be happy to teach you how to do that, too. These gasifiers produce charcoal while you cook your food. The char can and should be used in agriculture as Terra Preta, in order to reduce the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. Please check the posts below for more details.
