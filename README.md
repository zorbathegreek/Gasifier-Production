These gasifiers produce charcoal while you cook your food. The char can and should be used in agriculture as [Terra Preta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta), in order to reduce the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. [More details here](https://www.biochar.info/biochar.terra-preta.cfml) or check the posts below.
