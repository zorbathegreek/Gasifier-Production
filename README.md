# Gasifier production

This website shows how to make your own gasifier, e.g. to cook your meals. Please contribute if you can. We have trained groups of women and would like to show you how to do that, too. These gasifiers produce charcoal while you cook your food. The char can and should be used in agriculture as Terra Preta in order to reduce the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. Please check the posts below.
