# Gasifier production

This website contains videos that show you how to make your own gasifier, e.g. to cook your meals. A video about fuel drier fabrication is coming soon. Please [contribute to our videos](https://zorbathegreek.github.io/Gasifier-Production/how-to-contribute.html) if you can. We trained groups of women, and would be happy to teach you how to do that, too.

These gasifiers produce charcoal while you cook your food. The char can and should be used in agriculture as [Terra Preta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta) as a carbon sink, in order to reduce the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. [More details here](https://www.biochar.info/biochar.terra-preta.cfml) or check the posts below.
