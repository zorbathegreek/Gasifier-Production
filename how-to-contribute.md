### How to contribute to our gasifier production videos

This website is an extension of "The Carbon Shifters" website (link coming soon). We have decided to keep this part of our efforts separate to prevent confusion about the purpose of both parts of the same medal. We use Shotcut for video editing. It is available for Linux, Windows, and Apple <a href="https://shotcut.org">here</a>. 
The available footage and Shotcut project files (file extension: .mlt) can be downloaded [here](/assets/). You must store the footage and the .mlt file in the same folder.

Once you have the footage, and the project file, you can edit away on your machine if you have any improvements, and make a pull request for your new project file (.mlt).
You must store the footage and the .mlt file in the same folder.

### Why not upload your exported video? 
There is a quota of 1 GB per Github repo, and we don't want to exceed that easily. 
So please, make a pull request for your .mlt file, and we'll run it on Shotcut locally. This way, we are all looking at the same version without having to down- and upload tons of material.

If you dont know how to do edit videos, you can just make a video of your improvement with your (phone) camera, and make a pull request for your video file. 
If you don't know how to make a pull request, you could check various resources online, e.g. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4), which is no. 3 of a series of eight videos. 
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY) is where the series begins (no. 1 of 8). 

If you have questions, or want to raise an issue, please open a New Issue [here](https://github.com/zorbathegreek/gasifier-production/issues/new)
