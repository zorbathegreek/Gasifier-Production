### ... to our gasifier production videos

This website is an extension of "The Carbon Shifters" website (link coming soon). We have decided to keep this part of our efforts separate to prevent confusion. If you have watched our movies and want to improve them, translate the subtitles and/or the voice-overs, or contribute your own video, here is how you can do that. Welcome on board!  

We use Shotcut for video editing. It is available for Linux, Windows, and OSX <a href="https://shotcut.org">here</a>. 
The available footage and Shotcut project files (file extension: .mlt) are found [here](https://github.com/zorbathegreek/Gasifier-Production/tree/master/assets/footage
). 

Once you have the footage, and the project file, you can edit away on your machine, save your work, and make a pull request for your new project file (.mlt). You must store the footage and the .mlt file in the same folder.

### Why not upload your exported video? 
There is a quota of 1 GB per Github repo, and we don't want to exceed that, because the workaround is complicated. 
So please, make a pull request for your .mlt file, and we'll run it on our instance of Shotcut locally. If you use your own/additional footage, please make a pull request for it. If it too large, please send us a link (on box, dropbox, ..., your choice) so we can get hold of it and work with it. We will store your footage as .webm [here](https://github.com/zorbathegreek/Gasifier-Production/tree/master/assets/footage) This way, everyone is looking at the same material without having to down- and upload tons of material. We just have to exchange our .mlt files. If you want to get involved in our editing work group, we will of course let you use the original footage (which too large to store here). Just open an issue [here](https://github.com/zorbathegreek/gasifier-production/issues/new).  

If you don't know how to do edit videos, you can just make a video of your improvement with your (phone) camera, and make a pull request for your video file. Please note that the file size limit at github is 50 Mb. Larger will be rejected by github. If your file is too large, you should convert it, e.g. to the .webm format, before making a pull request. There are many online converter websites if you don't have any such program installed. [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) works miracles. You can get it here. https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#releases

If you don't know how to make a pull request on github, you could check various resources online, e.g. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4), which is no. 3 of a series of eight videos. 
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY) is where this series begins (no. 1 of 8). Please note that you need to sign up for a free account at github first: https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/

If you have questions, or want to raise an issue, please open a New Issue [here](https://github.com/zorbathegreek/gasifier-production/issues/new)

Please do not upload any video material that does not belong to you, or is not under your copyright, or not free as specified by Creative Commons, or restricted in any other way. Please note that if you upload material here, it will be in the public domain forever.
