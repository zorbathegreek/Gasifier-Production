### ... to our gasifier production videos

This website is an extension of "The Carbon Shifters" website (link coming soon). We have decided to keep this part of our efforts separate to prevent confusion. If you have watched our movies and want to improve them, or contribute your own, here is how you can do that.   

We use Shotcut for video editing. It is available for Linux, Windows, and Apple <a href="https://shotcut.org">here</a>. 
The available footage and Shotcut project files (file extension: .mlt) are found [here](../assets/). 

Once you have the footage, and the project file, you can edit away on your machine if you have any improvements, and make a pull request for your new project file (.mlt). You must store the footage and the .mlt file in the same folder.

### Why not upload your exported video? 
There is a quota of 1 GB per Github repo, and we don't want to exceed that easily. 
So please, make a pull request for your .mlt file, and we'll run it on Shotcut locally. This way, we are all looking at the same version without having to down- and upload tons of material.

If you don't know how to do edit videos, you can just make a video of your improvement with your (phone) camera, and make a pull request for your video file. Please note that the file size limit at github is 50 Mb. Files that are larger will be rejected by github. If your file is too large, you should convert it, e.g. to the .webm format, before making a pull request. There are many online converter websites if you don't have any such program installed. 

If you don't know how to make a pull request on github, you could check various resources online, e.g. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4), which is no. 3 of a series of eight videos. 
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY) is where this series begins (no. 1 of 8). 

If you have questions, or want to raise an issue, please open a New Issue [here](https://github.com/zorbathegreek/gasifier-production/issues/new)

Please do not upload any video material that does not belong to you, or is not under your copyright, or not free as specified by Creative Commons, or restricted in any other way. Please note that if you upload material here, it will be in the public domain forever.
