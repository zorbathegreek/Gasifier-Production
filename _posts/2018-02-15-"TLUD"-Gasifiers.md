### TLUD gasifiers
There are many different types of gasifiers. We are focussing on the TLUD type.  
TLUD stands for top lit up-draft, and it basically just means that you set your fuel in the gasifier on fire at the top, all over the surface.
We mostly use wood chips for fuel (or biomass pellets), and after a couple of moments, the first black spots appear; 
every piece of fuel then puts fire to its neighbour below, and soon the surface is all black from the forming charcoal. 
So in the beginning, you just have one flame, above the fuel.
The zone between wood and charcoal (the black material), a disk called pyrolysis zone, slowly travels downwards; probably at a rate of 1 cm every 2 minutes. 
So after a moment, we have two flames; one above the charcoal and another one in the pyrolysis disk. 

The air that keeps this process alive comes in from below and travels through the fuel, then it reaches the pyrolysis zone.
It's called primary air and it's flow must be somewhat throttled so that the gas that leaves the pyrolysis zone contains CO 
(and other gases), but no oxygen (O2). Above the charcoal, there is ambient air, and the flame which has been burning 
since the beginning consumes the gas that emerges from the charcoal.
